            Pandas like to sleep very much. In the wild, giant pandas sleep for 2-4 hours between meals. Giant pandas look cute even when they are sleeping. They are very flexible and can put their bulky bodies into a variety of poses. The favorite position is to prop up the legs on the tree and cover the eyes with the hands.</p>
            <p>The most adorable features of the giant panda are its chubby body and its slow walking style. This is because they live in an environment with sufficient food and no natural enemies, so there is no need to move quickly. But it's this sluggishness that allows it to conserve energy for low-calorie meals.</p>
            <p>Under normal circumstances, giant pandas are always very docile in temperament. When meeting people for the first time, they often cover their faces with their fore paws, or lower their heads so as not to reveal their true faces. They rarely aggressively attack other animals or people, and always avoid them when they meet by chance in the wild.</p>
